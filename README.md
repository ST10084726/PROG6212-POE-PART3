# Module Calculator Website
This Module Calculator Website is to help Lerato to organise her life better
### Introduction
This website will have to be able to store which modules a student is doing. Every module is
worth a specific number of credits. And that number multiplied by ten will be the number of
hours spent on it throughout the semester

## Troubleshooting
* If you try to log in or register using the file and the "lost password" function fails even though the password you entered is correct, there is a migration error, 
  and you must alter the migration name using the package management console.
* When features of a semester or module stop working, migration is usually at blame. It's a simple remedy; just open the Pavkage Manager console and write add-
  migration (name of migration), let it run, and then type update-database; if everything goes without a hitch, you can rerun the program and it will still function.
